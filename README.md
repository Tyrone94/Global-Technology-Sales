# üìä Uncovering Insights from a Global Technology Sales Dataset
This project dives deep into a global technology sales dataset to extract actionable business insights using Python and data analysis techniques. It focuses on identifying regional and categorical profitability, sales trends, discount impact, and data quality issues through visual storytelling and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

# üîç Project Objectives
Explore the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Understand performance across regions and product categories.

Visualize relationships between key metrics like Sales, Profit, Discount, and Quantity.

Generate insights to guide decision-making in sales strategy.
